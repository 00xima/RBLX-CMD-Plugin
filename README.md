Use this extremely versatile plugin to improve your workflow on Roblox Studio by quickly executing custom shortcuts.

#### How it works:

After you install the plugin, go to File > Advanced > Customize Shorcuts, search for "cmd+," and set the shorcut to your preference. A preferred shorcut is the "\`" key. After you assign your shorcut, press the key to open up the CMD+ CommandNode that is used to display all of the commands. You will then see all of the available commands.

For navigation, use your mouse normally or use the up, down, enter keys for selection. Start typing immediately to give input to the active Node.
